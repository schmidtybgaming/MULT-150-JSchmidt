public class GameCritic : MonoBehaviour

{
    // Game is too easy.
    // Would be harder with enemies and obstacles added or make it a vs cpu or multiplayer game.
    // "Wow" factor would be add more levels with different goal locations and play spaces.
    // Fun to push the balls to the goals but was annoying to restart game when there was glitch of the balls floating away from arena.

    // Exercise
    // Cover water outside arena borders with terrain and game objects.
    // Added start button from Hour 6.
    // Added timer from Hour 6.
    // Made the bumper bigger to have better control of the balls.
    // Added more shapes to bumper.
