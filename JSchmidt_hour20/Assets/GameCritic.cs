public class GameCritic : MonoBehaviour
{
   // 1. The game is a fair challange but more on the difficult side because of the game speed and how close the obstacles are to the powerups.
   // 2. I would make the game easier by allowing the player to move fowards and backwards and able to jump.
   // 3. The game would have a wow facter with more levels and more interactable prefabs like different powerups and obstacles and prefabs to hide behind.
   // 4. The game is fun because of the challenge of moving the player and collecting power ups.
   // 5. The game is tedious because of the repeatitive actings collecting and avoiding prefabs as well as limited controls only going side to side.
    
    // I changed the obtacle prefab making it a spiky sphere and by switching the material to a cooled lava.
    // I changed the powerup prefab by changing it into an apple and for the particle system a shorter start lifetime, a smaller start size, and longer rate over time.
